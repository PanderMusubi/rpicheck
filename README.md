:construction: Looking for adoption :construction:
------------

RasPi Check started as a little personal project, from which I've never thought, that it would reach so many Raspberry Pi ® users. However, I no longer have the time (and patience) to keep this project up-2-date and especially to keep up with Google Play Store guidelines and Android API changes.

This being said, **version 1.8.14 is the final release** of RasPi Check (available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=de.eidottermihi.raspicheck) and on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eidottermihi/rpicheck/releases/tag/v1.8.14)).

If you have experience in maintaining an Android app & would like to take over the (outdated) codebase of RasPi Check, please reach out to me.

Android app for checking the status of your Raspberry Pi ® or other SBCs.

The goal of this Android app is to show the user the current system status of a running Raspberry Pi ®.

RasPi Check uses a SSH connection (using [SSHJ](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj)) to connect to your Raspberry Pi ® and queries the information using Linux utilities like `ps`, `df` or the [`/proc` virtual filesystem](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html). This app also works on other SBCs via [fake_vcgencmd](https://github.com/clach04/fake_vcgencmd), e.g. when running [Armbian](https://www.armbian.com).
